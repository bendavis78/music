# Collaborate with a classmate on a new project

## Create a "music library" page

**Requirements:**

* Use materialize (http://materializecss.com)
* The page should show multiple albums, songs, and artists as large square thumbnails.
* Show some basic information below each thumbnail
* Make the thumbnail zoom in when clicked (similar to portfolio page)
* Make it responsive. Test it out on multiple screen sizes. Use Chrome's "[mobile device mode](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode)" (Ctrl + Shift +M)
* Extra credit: add some basic navigation at the top of the screen (it can be "dummy" navigation, the buttons don't have to do anything for now).

Use the following screenshots for a rough idea of what to do (be creative, don't make an exact match):
